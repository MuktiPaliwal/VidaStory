Red Riding Hood

Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a house near the woods. Whenever she went out of the house,
she always wore a red hooded cloak, so everyone started calling her Red Riding Hood. 

One spring morning, Red Riding Hood asked her mother is she could visit her grandmom.
